# Paper Publication Tracking Portal

Every year there are lots of research papers published, with the increase in domains the number papers published are also increased, so to keep track of the paper published by every author we aim to develop a Publication Tracking Portal. A Publication Tracker is a portal that tracks papers made by students and researchers alike. It tracks the status of their paper and lets them know whether they have been published and where they have been published.

The portal starts with the Author uploading their manuscripts and an editor will be assigned to the paper published by the author who verifies whether the Basic Requirements met and then assign reviewers. After Reviewers review and give recommendations, the editor collects the reviews and decides whether to Accept, Reject or ask the author to revise the paper and go through the process again.
 
In our project we are planning to add SMS functionality to notify the Author about the status of the paper. We are using the latest tech to implement our project. So, it can be adapted, developed and improvised further in the future.
